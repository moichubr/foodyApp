# foodyApp
This is a SPA project that I developed by myself in 30 days, from the database, through the backend and frontend too.
It implement technologies such as React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, CSS3 and HTML5. I did not use any library
or extra tool.
About the content of the App, it works as a recipe book where users could search precharged recipes 
by diets, by healthscore and by name. The App have a section that allows them to create there own recipes and save them,
having the opportunity to look at it in other moment.
I'm glad about the result, for sure I have things to learn and get better because we are always learning but considering the time that
I had to do it, I think I made a good job. 
Thanks for reading :)
